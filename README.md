# Berry

Berry is a multipurpose cli tools for creating files and directory (and more soon...). Not only that, berry can also create to-do task. It is a toy project not intended for anyone to use. It is simply made for fun.

## Installing

I haven't published this as a gem yet so you'll have to do it manually.

```bash
# Install all of the required gems 
gem install

# Build and install berry as a gem
Rake install

# Rub berry
berry
```
