# Berry

Berry is a multipurpose cli tools for creating files and directory (and more soon...). Not only that, berry can also create to-do task (which is not yet implemented). It is a toy project not intended for anyone to use. It is simply made for fun.

Berry supposedly stands for "Better Directory" but really, it isn't. Should be named worry instead, you know what I meant.

## Installing

bundle install

# Build and install berry as a gem
Rake install

# Run berry
